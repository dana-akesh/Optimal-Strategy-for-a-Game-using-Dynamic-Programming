# Optimal-Strategy-for-a-Game-using-Dynamic-Programming
Are you looking to improve your game and dominate the competition? Dynamic programming can help! It is an algorithm to solve complex optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem only once.

By analyzing all possible moves and outcomes, dynamic programming takes into account the current state of the game and your opponent's potential future moves. This helps you find the best possible strategy and gives you a competitive edge that your opponent won't be able to match.
